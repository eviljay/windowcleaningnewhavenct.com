This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms.</a></p></div></div></div></section><footer id=footer class="footer section"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6"><div class="footer-widget widget"><h6 class=text-white>New Haven Best Window Cleaning & Repairs</h5><h6 class=address-txt>1401 Chapel St</h6><span class=text-white>New Haven, CT</span><h6 class=address-txt>06511</h6><ul class="list-unstyled footer-menu mt-4"><li><a href=mailto:windowcleaningnewhavenct01@gmail.com><i class=ti-email></i>windowcleaningnewhavenct01@gmail.com</a></li></ul><ul class="list-inline footer-socials"><li class=list-inline-item><a target=_blank href=https://www.facebook.com/New-Haven-Best-Window-Cleaning-Repairs-105074292118898/><i class=ti-facebook></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFV2Yh7kiTSCV4iEfRLrrg><i class=ti-youtube></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a target=_blank href=https://www.instagram.com/windowcleaningnewhavenct/><i class=ti-instagram></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/haven_window><i class=ti-twitter></i></a></li></ul></div><ul class="list-inline legal-links"><li class=list-inline-item><a rel=nofollow href=/terms/>terms</a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a rel=nofollow href=/privacy/>privacy</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-btm py-4"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-lg-6><div class="copyright text-center">This is a referral website.
